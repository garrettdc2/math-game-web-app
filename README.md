# Minimum Viable Factory

Ticket in, deployed web app out. The full SDLC — spec, architecture, code, review, tests, deploy — handled by Claude Code agents running in parallel. You approve at three gates.

**~700 lines of Python across 16 modules. 6 skills. 5 MCPs. You can read every file in one sitting.**

Right now this factory greenfields web apps from idea to production. You describe what you want, agents build and deploy it from scratch. Each app gets its own GitHub repo. Large tasks are automatically decomposed into subtasks and built in parallel. Brownfield support (existing codebases, new features, bug fixes) is next.

## The 11 Primitives Every Software Factory Needs

We tried to figure out the smallest set of building blocks that turns a ticket into a deployed app. Every factory needs these — the specific tools are up to you:

| # | Primitive | What It Does | This Factory Uses |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Record** | Where work gets tracked | Linear (project: "software factory") |
| 2 | **Memory** | How agents share context | `memory/` — one markdown file per ticket, append-only |
| 3 | **Orchestrator** | What decides who runs next | LangGraph state machine in `orchestrator/` |
| 4 | **Execution Env** | Where agents actually run | Docker container |
| 5 | **Agent Runtime** | The brain behind each agent | Claude Code via `claude-agent-sdk` |
| 6 | **Integration Layer** | How agents talk to external tools | 5 MCPs: Jira, GitHub, Netlify, Supabase, Slack |
| 7 | **Quality Gates** | Where humans stay in the loop | LangGraph `interrupt()` + Slack notifications |
| 8 | **Delivery Target** | Where the app gets deployed | Netlify (frontend) + Supabase (database, standalone) |
| 9 | **Observability** | How you see what's happening | LangSmith traces + Linear sub-issue tracking |
| 10 | **Skills** | What each agent knows how to do | `.claude/skills/` — 6 markdown files |
| 11 | **Identity & Secrets** | How agents authenticate | `.env` file mounted into Docker |

Swap any of these out. Use Jira instead of Linear. Deploy to Railway instead of Netlify. Use Vercel instead of Netlify. The primitives are the pattern. The tools are interchangeable.

## How It Works

```
Ticket created in Linear
        |
Webhook fires --> orchestrator/api.py
        |
Create GitHub repo for the app
        |
Create 6 stage sub-issues in Linear (one per agent)
        |
PM Agent writes spec --> memory file
        |   🟢 Spec sub-issue checked off
        |
[GATE 1] 🟡 Waiting: "Move to In Arch to approve."
        |   🟢 Approved (or 🔴 Blocked)
        |
Architect Agent writes technical plan + subtasks
        |   🟢 Architecture sub-issue checked off
        |
[GATE 2] 🟡 Waiting: "Move to In Dev to approve."
        |   🟢 Approved (or 🔴 Blocked)
        |
Decompose: parse subtasks from architecture
        |
N × Dev Agents run in parallel (one per subtask, same branch)
        |   🟢 Progress posted per subtask
        |
Single PR opened with all changes
        |   🟢 Implementation sub-issue checked off
        |
Review Agent + Test Agent run in parallel
        |   🟢 Code Review + Tests sub-issues checked off
        |
[GATE 3] 🟡 Waiting: "Move to In Deploy to approve."
        |   🟢 Approved (or 🔴 Blocked)
        |
Deploy Agent ships to Netlify + Supabase
        |   🟢 Deploy sub-issue checked off
        |
🟢 Done — final summary posted with repo link + deploy URL
```

Each agent is a Claude Code session running inside Docker. It reads the full memory file, follows its skill instructions, appends its output, and moves on. No agent-to-agent chatter. The memory file is the only shared state.

## Linear as a Dashboard

When a pipeline starts, the orchestrator:

1. Creates a new GitHub repo for the app
2. Creates 6 sub-issues under the parent ticket — one per agent stage
3. Posts a checklist comment on the parent ticket

As the pipeline runs, every event is posted to the Linear issue:

| Event | Comment |
|-------|---------|
| Pipeline start | ⚪ Pipeline started + stage checklist |
| Repo created | ⚪ Repository link |
| Agent starts | 🟡 "Spec — agent started" |
| Agent finishes | 🟢 "Spec — complete" + output excerpt |
| Gate waiting | 🟡 "Gate 1 — waiting for approval" |
| Gate approved | 🟢 "Gate 1 — approved" |
| Gate rejected | 🔴 "Gate 1 — rejected" |
| Subtask done | 🟢 "Subtask 2/5 done: Auth setup" |
| Error/timeout | 🔴 Error details + blocked reason |
| Pipeline done | 🟢 Final summary with repo + deploy URL |

Sub-issues are checked off as each agent completes. The parent issue becomes a complete record of the journey from idea to deployment.

## LangSmith Tracing

Every external call is traced as a nested span under the pipeline run:

- Linear GraphQL calls, sub-issue lifecycle
- Slack webhook posts
- Memory file reads and writes
- Each agent session, each parallel subtask
- Gate decisions, pipeline start/resume
- Webhook processing

## Try It

### What you need

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) (or any tunnel to expose port 8000)
- API keys for [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Slack](https://api.slack.com/)
- [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) (optional, for tracing)

### 1. Clone and add your keys

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashtilawat/minimum-viable-factory.git
cd minimum-viable-factory
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env`:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_...
LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
GITHUB_ORG=your-org-or-username
NETLIFY_TOKEN=...
SUPABASE_TOKEN=...
SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=lsv2_...          # optional
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=your-project-name  # optional
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true            # optional
```

### 2. Set up Linear

Create these workflow states in your team settings (exact names matter):

```
Backlog --> In Spec --> In Arch --> In Dev --> In QA --> In Deploy --> Done --> Blocked
```

Create a project called **software factory** — all factory issues will live here.

Turn off all **Pull request automations** — the orchestrator handles state transitions.

### 3. Connect the webhook

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

In Linear: **Settings > API > Webhooks > New webhook**
- URL: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/webhook/linear`
- Resource types: Issues only

Copy the signing secret to `LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`.

### 4. Set up Slack

Create an app at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps):
- Bot scopes: `chat:write`, `channels:read`
- Install to workspace, grab the bot token (`xoxb-...`) for `SLACK_TOKEN`
- Enable Incoming Webhooks, add one to your channel for `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
- Invite the bot: `/invite @YourAppName`

### 5. Start the factory

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

### 6. Create a ticket and watch it run

Write a Linear ticket describing what you want built. Move it to **In Spec**.

The factory creates a GitHub repo, then the PM Agent writes a spec. You get a Slack message at Gate 1. Move to **In Arch**. The Architect plans the implementation and breaks it into subtasks. Move to **In Dev**. Parallel Dev Agents build each subtask — progress is posted to the Linear issue. When all subtasks land, a single PR is opened. Review and test agents run on the combined PR. Move to **In Deploy**. The app deploys to Netlify (frontend) and Supabase (database, provisioned standalone). Done.

Every step is logged to the Linear issue. Open it to see the full journey.
